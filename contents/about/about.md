I grew up in Bangkok, city far from perfect.  
Since I was very young, I've been enthusiastic on video games.  
Initally I was just enjoying the game itself, where later on I would try to break it, tweak it, mingle with it.  
Curiosity has introduced me to game trainers / mods / scripts and landed me on to programming in general.

After attending the best university that the Southern Hemisphere can offer - University of Melbourne.  
I started to work as a integration/architecture consultant on Accenture. I had been trained on multiple client-facing aspects.

After two years I decided to leave the company in order to challenge myself.  
I landed on Agoda where everything is new and interesting for me.  
Currently I'm working to incorporate DevSecOps into Agoda while also occationally contribute to Open Source community on GitHub.
