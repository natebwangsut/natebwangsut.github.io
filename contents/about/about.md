I grew up in Bangkok, city far from perfect.  
Since I was very young, I've been enthusiastic on video games.  
Initially I was just enjoying the game itself, where later on I would try to break it, tweak it, mingle with it.  
I wanted to understand how the game functions and how to create one, eventually it introduced me to programming.

I've graduated from the [University of Melboune](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), major in Computer and Software Systems.  
I love cycling, and I love to read.
I regularly contributed to open source projects on GitHub [(@natebwangsut)](https://github.com/natebwangsut).
