Since I was very young, I've been enthusiastic on video games.  
Initially I was just enjoying the game itself, where later on I would try to break it, tweak it, mingle with it.  
I wanted to understand how the game functions and how to create one, eventually it introduced me to programming.  

I've graduated from the [University of Melboune](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), major in Computer and Software Systems.  
I regularly contributed to open source projects on GitHub [(@natebwangsut)](https://github.com/natebwangsut).

I love cycling, and I love to read.
If you found any books about psychology, self-improvement or anything else that I should read, please let me know. Feel free to discuss with me on Twitter [(@natebwangsut)](https://twitter.com/natebwangsut), thoughts and opinions are of my own.
