After my journey with Accenture, I joined Agoda as a software engineer to embark on integrating Agoda with security best-practices.
Don't get me wrong, Agoda had its security practices in-place. My work is to `shift-left` those security hurdles.

I will be adding more context to this section once I got more stories to be told.
