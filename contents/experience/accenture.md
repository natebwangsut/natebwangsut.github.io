With Accenture, I've joined in a project where we would revolutionised how our client worked.  
We did a digital transformation which disrupts the financial industry at the time.  
Our client was one of the first to deploy mobile banking application in ASEAN which leads the entire market.  
The achievement proved to be successful as we got future clients asking us to help them digitalise their practice.

In order to achieve our targets, we digitalised our client process. We analysed the flaws of traditional procedure,  
improving them with a leaner one and transfers our expertise to our client so that they are empowered to proceed with the new operations.
