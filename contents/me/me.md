<!-- I'm from Bangkok, Thailand -->
<!-- I lived in Melbourne for 3-4 years pursuring my university degree -->

I'm a software engineer living in Bangkok, Thailand.  
I do everything computer releated: games, audiophile, network, etc.  
My hobby is to make a pull-request on GitHub.  
I also provide advice / consultation for public cloud implementation and architecture.
