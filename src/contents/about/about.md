Since young, Nate has been very enthusiastic about technology.  
He first interacted with a computer when he was five, playing a game of solitaire.  
From there onward, he would be intrigued on how the computer system works and started to experiment with it.

In school, he was introduced to the programming side of the world, and he aspired to become a software engineer.  
He went on to graduate from the [University of Melboune](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), major in Computer and Software Systems.

Nate has started his career as a consultant where he was exposed to the technology industry where he was inspired to use his knowledge and contribute to the world for a greater good.
Since then, he has been regularly contributed to opensource projects on GitHub [(@natebwangsut)](https://github.com/natebwangsut) and started [(digitaldove)](https://github.com/digitaldove) to be able to reach out to more people.
